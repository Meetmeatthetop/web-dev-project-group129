Subject: Report on Git Contribution Glitch in Group Assignment Submission

Dear Power Learn Project Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to report a technical issue we encountered during the submission of our group assignment. One of our team members, Gikonyo Omoga (GitHub username: Cypher-star-dev, email: omogagikonyo31@gmail.com), was a major contributor to the project, particularly in developing the HTML structure and sourcing images used in the assignment.

However, due to a glitch in our group repository, his contributions and commits were not reflecting properly at the time we were expected to submit. As a result, his name and contributions did not appear in the repositoryâ€™s contribution history.

This issue caused a delay in our submission as we attempted to troubleshoot it, but being new to Git, we were unable to resolve it in time. After several unsuccessful attempts, we decided to submit the assignment along with this explanatory letter to ensure transparency and fairness.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding of the situation.
Please feel free to contact us if further clarification or supporting evidence is needed.

Thank you for your continued support and for providing us with this learning opportunity.

Best regards,
